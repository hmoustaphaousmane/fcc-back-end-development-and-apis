# fcc-back-end-development-and-apis

In this repository are the submission project files for the Back End Development and APIs Certification by FreeCodeCamp, where I learned how to write back end apps with Node.js and npm.  I was able to build web applications and microservices with the Express framework, MongoDB and the Mongoose library.
